# Sunday ProPresenter Seat Outline

This is designed to be a checklist/guide to running the presentation computer, TV's, projector and
lights for Sunday services.

## Pre-Service

### 7:00am: Setup

1. Ensure media computer is on. It is a good idea to reboot it at this time too.
1. While the computer is rebooting, it is a good idea to make sure the blue stage lights are on.
1. Make sure the power strip is turned on that runs the rail lights in the booth
1. Turn on the center and side lights for practice.
1. Make sure the volume is all the way up on the computer

### During practice

The songs should already be loaded in the correct section in ProPres.

1. Pay attention to the practice and make sure the song order is correct. Adjust the arrangement as
   needed.
1. Ensure the lyrics are formatted properly.
   - 1920 x 1080 screen size
   - No more than 4 lines per slide
   - Font size > 80pt < 100pt
   - Try to ensure line breaks make sense with song
   - Use groups! (Verse 1, Chorus, Verse 2, Bridge, etc)
   - The first slide should be in the intro group with no background, a clear all queue, and Worship
     screen set.

### Between Practice and Service
