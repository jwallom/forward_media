## Important Scene Setup information

This section covers any guidelines of how new scenes should be setup. In general new scenes should be uncommon, but are sometimes needed for special guests and outreach.

- Scenes should contain one audio source per video source.  That means the house sound should not be brought in to a scene that does not also have action/talking from the camera feeds.

- Media should be played locally on the streaming PC if at all possible, and not brought in from external sources like ProPresenter.
