# Sunday Morning Checklist

Welcome to the Live Stream checklist. This is a living document and will change
as we improve services. Please note that the prioty of the stream is to keep
recording.  If we lose the internet connection, or experience network issues,
never stop OBS from recording. We can use the recording to upload a full
service during the week.

## Pre-Practice

### Hardware Setup

- [ ] Reboot Computer
- [ ] Turn on camera on tripod. Make sure PTZ is on and controllable with
  controller.
  - [ ] Set tripod camera to a wide, centered shot. Ideally make sure all
    singers are in shot with a little extra room left and right.
- [ ] Turn on powerstrip with lights

### Software Setup

- [ ] Log into streaming computer
- [ ] Start OBS
  - [ ] Start streaming
- [ ] Open Chrome
  - [ ] Launch Restream.io website

      ![open restream](./images/open-restream.png)

  - [ ] Update title and discription in restream.io [^1]
  - [ ] Launch Facebook

      ![open facebook](./images/open-facebook.png)

    - [ ] Setup Forward Church Online Community Stream, but do not go live yet
      - On the left side of the Facebook page is a shortcuts section. Select
        *Forward Church Online Community*.

      - Click the *Write something* dialogue in the center like you are going
        to write a new post.

          ![write something](./images/fb-write-something.png)

      - Click the 3 `...` option on the new post, and select *Live Video*.

          ![click elipse](./images/fb-click-elipse.png)

      - The left option, red icon, is go live. Click the *Go Live* button on
        the bottom of this column. It will not start the stream, but will get
        you to the screen to setup the livestream.

          ![select go live](./images/fb-go-live.png)

      - Set the same title and description you set in restream.

          ![set title](./images/fb-set-title.png)

      - Go live to the Facebook Group in Restream and make sure it is recieving
        on the Facebook Community Group.
      - Wait till 9:55 to go live on the Facebook Group Page after starting the
        preservice video.

          ![go live](./images/fb-go-live-2.png)

  - Open a new tab and select the *Center Cam - Tracking* bookmark from the
    cameras folder in the bookmark bar.
    - Tracking is a priority during the message portion to ensure editing later
      in the week an get the best shots for all services.

        ![tracking diagram](./images/tracking-02.png)

        1. (1) Drop down for target selection and silhouette manipulation
        1. (2) Silhouette size option
        1. (3) Tracking on and off toggle

        Make sure the center camera is not the live camera before turning on
        the tracking software. When turned on, it will move the camera around.
        This is normal and you will need to readjust it with the controller.
        Once locked on you can switch back to the center camera.

        Make sure to set another camera as an emergency go-to. The tracking can
        lose the target if the face disappears from view. This can happen if
        they turn away from the camera or move too rapidly.

During practice is a good time to make some notes on parts of worship that
might be good for getting tight shots with camera 2.  Using the slide numbers
on pro-presenter and writing shot ideas down can make it easier during worship
live.

[^1]: There should be an email in Apple Mail with the week's title and
    description. If it is not there, please find Clint or whoever is preaching
that week.

## Pre-Service

- [ ] Between practice and pre-service is a good time to add any special videos
  or media to the OBS scenes if applicable

Starting 5 minuted before 10am, we start pre-service.

- [ ] Start recording in OBS (this is a good time to also remind and assist the
  sound engineer to start recording)
- [ ] Make the pre-service video live in OBS
- [ ] Start stream in Forward Church **Private group** only

## Service

- [ ] As worship is winding up (use your judgment) make sure all three streams
  go live. (YouTube **Page** and Facebook **Public** need to turn on)

Be awesome and do a great job!

## Post Service

- [ ] Start the post service video in OBS as the service closes.  This needs to
  be done ASAP so we do not broadcast copywrited music.
- [ ] Stop recording on the video cameras
- [ ] While the end service video plays, go to both mixers and remove the flash
  drives (make sure the sound person stopped recording).
  - [ ] Attach the USBs to the streaming PC, and copy the audio recording from
    it to `LIVESTREAM` folder.
- [ ] When the post service video is over, stop streams
  - [ ] Stop Restream.io
  - [ ] Stop streaming in OBS
- [ ] Stop OBS recording
